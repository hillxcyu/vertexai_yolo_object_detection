# Vertex AI Custom YOLO Training Pipeline

This project provides a complete pipeline to:

1.  Train a YOLO model on a Vertex AI Managed Dataset using a **Vertex AI Custom Training job**.
2.  Build a custom inference Docker container using a **local model and a custom prediction routine**. This routine formats the output to match the standard prediction schema used by AutoML object detection models.
3.  Upload the trained model, container image, and schemas to the **Vertex AI Model Registry**.

## Prerequisites

  * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) must be installed and running.
  * Python 3 and required packages.

Install the Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration and Setup

Follow these steps before running the pipeline.

### 1\. GCP Authentication

You must authenticate both your local SDK environment and your application default credentials.

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
```

### 2\. Dataset Location (Important Requirement)

Your Vertex AI Managed Dataset **must** be located in a GCS bucket within the **same Google Cloud Project** where this training job will run.

This is a firm requirement because the custom training job utilizes the GCS FUSE mount feature. This feature automatically mounts all GCS buckets *from the host project* to the `/gcs/` directory in the training container. Buckets from *other* projects will not be mounted, and the job will fail.

### 3\. Pipeline Configuration

Edit the variables at the top of `launch_training_job.py` to match your environment. At a minimum, you must set your project-specific details:

  * `PROJECT_ID`
  * `REGION`
  * `BUCKET_URI` (the staging bucket for the pipeline)
  * Dataset and Model display names

## üöÄ How to Run

Once configured, launch the entire pipeline by executing the main script:

```bash
python3 launch_training_job.py
```
